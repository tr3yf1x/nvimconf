# My NVIM-Config
Nothing special, just the usual little stuff like my currently prefered theme, keybindgs.
Ohh, and it comes with a pathogen installation. Maybe this config saves somebody else a moment or two per server/pc/mac/potato

## Linux/Mac/BSD etc.
To overwrite your current config on a *nix:
>./setnvim.sh

To store your current config in the folder you used for this repo
>./getnvim.sh

Maybe you need to make it runable first (chmod +x) or call it with sudo. 
Per usual: read the code and try to understand it before you run it (atleast if you try to run it with sudo).
